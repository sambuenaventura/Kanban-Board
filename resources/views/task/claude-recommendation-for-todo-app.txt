Your Laravel todo application sounds like a solid start for a portfolio project. Let's break down your questions and discuss how you can enhance your project and your overall profile as an aspiring backend developer.

Is your current todo app enough to impress recruiters?

Your app has some good features, including:

Basic CRUD operations (adding tasks)
Kanban-style board (inspired by Jira)
Drag and drop functionality
Filtering by tags

These demonstrate your ability to implement common web application features. However, to really stand out, you might want to add more complexity and showcase your backend skills.

Additional features you could add:


//User authentication and authorization
//Task assignments to different users
Due dates and reminders
File attachments for tasks
Activity log/audit trail
API endpoints for potential mobile app integration
Real-time updates using WebSockets
Task prioritization
Recurring tasks
Time tracking for tasks
Reporting and analytics features
Integration with external services (e.g., email notifications, calendar integration)


Project ideas for an aspiring backend developer:


A RESTful API for a complex domain (e.g., e-commerce, financial transactions)
A real-time chat application with WebSockets
A content management system with a headless architecture
A job board with search functionality and recommendation engine
A booking system (for restaurants, appointments, etc.)
A social media platform backend
A microservices-based application


Edges to get ahead and shine to recruiters:


Learn and implement automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests)
Gain experience with containerization (Docker) and container orchestration (Kubernetes)
Implement CI/CD pipelines for your projects
Learn about and implement caching strategies (Redis, Memcached)
Explore message queues for asynchronous processing (Laravel Queues, RabbitMQ)
Implement proper logging and monitoring in your applications
Gain experience with cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure)
Learn about and implement security best practices
Contribute to open-source projects
Write technical blog posts about your learning experiences and projects
Optimize your applications for performance and scalability

By focusing on these areas, you'll not only improve your technical skills but also demonstrate to recruiters that you understand the broader aspects of backend development beyond just writing code.
Remember, the key is not just to implement features, but to understand the underlying concepts, best practices, and trade-offs involved in each decision. This deeper understanding, combined with practical experience, will make you stand out to recruiters and potential employers.
