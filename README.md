## Introduction
This repository contains the code for a Kanban Board application that I developed to improve my backend development skills using Laravel. It is a full-stack web application that allows users to create and manage tasks. Key features include drag-and-drop functionality, subscription-based features with multiple pricing plans using Laravel Cashier (Stripe), and real-time updates using Laravel Echo and Reverb. I also used PHPUnit for feature and unit testing to ensure the application works as intended, and Docker was implemented for future deployment.
